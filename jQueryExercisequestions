$(document).ready(function(){
    var mainElement = document.getElementById('main'); // THIS IS NOT GREAT!
});

/*Why is the code above not great? Because we are mixing jQuery with vanilla JavaScript, when jQuery 
offers us a more concise syntax! So let's use jQuery selectors instead of document.getElementbyId.
 A cleaner version would be: */

$(document).ready(function(){
    var $mainElement=$("#main")});
    
    /* 1.What is jQuery? What does it enable you to do?
    jQuery is the most popular library on the web today. It's a library of JavaScript functions that make 
    it easy for webpage developers to do common tasks-- like manipulating the webpage, responding to user 
    events, getting data from their servers, building effects and animations, and much more.

    2.What does the $ represent in jQuery?
    $ sign is just a valid javascript identifier which is used as an alias for jQuery. */
